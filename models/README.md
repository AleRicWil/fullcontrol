# example models

two parametric models and a design template are provided to demonstrate the use of FullControl 

1. the 'nonplanar spacer' model from [fullcontrol.xyz](https://fullcontrol.xyz/#/models/971ff7) in a jupytner notebook format - [nonplanar_spacer.ipynb](https://githubtocolab.com/FullControlXYZ/fullcontrol/blob/master/models/colab/nonplanar_spacer_colab.ipynb)
1. a new model (not on the website) to produce nuts, bolts and threaded tubes - [nuts_and_bolts.ipynb](https://githubtocolab.com/FullControlXYZ/fullcontrol/blob/master/models/colab/nuts_and_bolts_colab.ipynb)
1. colab design template - [colab_design_template.ipynb](https://githubtocolab.com/FullControlXYZ/fullcontrol/blob/master/models/colab/colab_design_template.ipynb)


the above links open the models in google colab, but they can also be downloaded and run on a local version of python with FullControl installed
